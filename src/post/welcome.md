Thank Github!

Welcome to lilac's theme: less.

It's a clean, light, good-looking theme, with red as its main color.

This is a sample post to show what dose the post look like in theme less.

Here is an example of code highlighting:

```python
for item in range(10):
    if item % 2 == 0:
        print item
```
